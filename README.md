# analyzing_historical_stock
Project from the Edx course "Python for Data Science Project" IBM PY0220EN.

## __Aim of the course__
This course aimed at demonstrating foundational Python skills for working with data. The completion of this course involves working on a hands-on project about historical stock data to develop a simple dashboard using Python. Python Basics for Data Science course from IBM is a pre-requisite for this project course.

### __Description of the project__
The project focuses on 2 popular stocks: Tesla and GameStop. In this course, I extracted revenue and stock data prices for Tesla and GameStop using Web Scraping and build a dashboard to compare the price of the stock vs the revenue.
